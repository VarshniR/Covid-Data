### Covid-Data

So, I have been struggling finding a job and I got a lot of advise from my peers, I worked on revamping my resume and some people suggested I add more to my Github portfolio. 
The goal is to add all the queries I write as practice tasks to my Github profile, at least 3 times every week. Having said that, these might not always be pretty or very well put together.

This is a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle **Worldwide Covid Cases & Vaccination Data Combined (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunwarakash/covid-cases-and-vaccination-data)**

Here are some of the questions I tried to answer based on the dataset:
1. Which are the top 5 countries with the highest number of fully vaccinated people?
2. What are the avergae total deaths from Covid per country?
3. What are the totals of covid cases and covid deaths in every country?
4. How many covid cases and covid deaths were reported between 01-22-2020 and 02-22-2020 and in which countries?
5. When was the first Covid-19 case reported in Suriname?
